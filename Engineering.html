            <p>Because getting into real cars and racing them around a track is too much effort (and is kind of 

dangerous), the natives here build full-size cars that they can control from the comfort and safety of 

their couches, and race them around devilishly difficult tracks. This has, in fact, evolved into the national 

pastime. At Pravega, we host a scaled down version of this heart-stopper of an event.</p>

            <p>Because they have never won a gold in the national “tag” Olympics held every year, the dwellers here 

first invented the Laser tag. With the lasers ensuring that even the swiftest runner wouldn’t be able to 

outrun the beams, this new variety of tag quickly gained popularity. (The people of this region never 

managed to win a gold in this event either, but that’s another story…)

          <h5>Game Rules:</h5>

          1) There would be different races for both classes of cars viz. electric and IC. IC RC car racing is

          arranged on 29th Jan 2016 and electric RC car racing is arranged on 31th Jan 2016. Same track

          and obstacles would be there for both classes of car. The only difference which would be there

          is that for IC cars most of the track would be dirt track while for electric RC car most of the track

          would be covered with carpet.<br/>

          2) There can be maximum 4 and minimum 2 people in one team.<br/>

          3) Participants can take part in both the races, provided that they have different classes of cars for

          both races.<br/>

          4) Participants are required to submit an abstract about their work explaining the steering

          mechanism, suspension mechanism and the chassis layout. Abstract must be of maximum 2-3

          pages. Photographs must also be attached of work done on machine. These photographs are

          required for verifying that the machine has been indigenously built. Abstract must be mailed to

          pranjal@pravega.org or jyotish@pravega.org before 25th Jan 2016.<br/>

          5) Round 1: Each team would be getting 2 laps out of which the faster lap will be considered.

          Second lap must be taken within next half hour, once the first lap is ended. Based on the timing

          of laps of all teams, different groups would be formed by organizing panel. Those teams having

          better lap timing in round 1 will get some privileged in round 2.<br/>

          6) Round 2: After the round 1, there will be races between multiple cars at a time of group formed

          after round 1. So the participants preferably should use a remote with frequency of higher band

          spectrum. Number of teams in the group and number of groups will be decided depending on

          number of registrations for the event.<br/>

          7) Round 3: Top cars from all the groups in round 2 would be chosen and will compete against each

          other in final round.<br/>

          8) Team members are not permitted to touch either their machines or those of their opponents

          once the race begins. The penalty for doing so is disqualification.<br/>

          9) The track will have check points at regular intervals. If a machine tumbles, halts or goes off the

          arena at any point on the track, one of our volunteer will lift it up and place it at the nearest

          checkpoint (as it is) behind that point. The time shall still be running in the meantime. Volunteer

          would try to do this as fast as possible. In case of any controversies, decision of

          organizing/mentor panel shall be treated as final.<br/>

          10) In all the rounds, a maximum of two team members are allowed from a team in the racing arena

          (including driver himself).<br/>

          11) The machines are not allowed to leave any loose parts on any part of the arena. Any machine

          disintegrating during the race will be disqualified. <br/>

          12) If any of the machines starts off before the flag is waved, the counter would be restarted and

          the machines will get a second chance. However, if any machine starts off before the waving of

          flag (or countdown) for a second time, it will be disqualified. No rematch will be held for the

          second time. <br/>

          13) Teams are not allowed to purposefully damage the machine of the opponent's team. If found

          guilty for doing so on track (while racing), the concerned team will be disqualified. Execution of

          last three rules will be subjective and relies completely on judges' and organizers’ discretion.<br/>

          14) Judges decision shall be treated as final and binding on all.<br/>

          15) The organizers reserve the rights to change any or all of the above rules as they deem fit.

          Change in rules, if any will be highlighted on the website and notified to the registered

          participants.<br/>

          <b>Note:</b> You can also submit a video of your car. The video should be an unedited clip, showing the

          machine running at least 10-15 meters and completing a 8-shaped track. Video submission is optional

          but this can help you in getting proper advice from mentor panel before the day of racing, so that you

          can be one step ahead of other competent racers.<br/></br>
          
          <h5>Arena:</h5>

          <p>The track will be an all-terrain track with sharp turns and big jumps. Both speed and control would be

            the important factor in deciding the winner. The car should be able to cross bumps, rough patches on

            the track and outdo the opponent’s car while maintaining its stability and not compromising with its

            pace. The track will be an off road track. Most parts of the track will be made up of mud (mostly dry),

            just like dirt tracks, however at a few places wood and carpet can be used. For Electric RC car race most

            of the track would be covered with carpet.</p>

            1) The width of the track will be around 4-5 feet for most of the part. The total size of arena would be

            around 70×40 feet. On an average, the car would cover 400 feet in one lap.<br>

            2) A control stand will be provided along the track for the driver to position himself to control his vehicle

            during the run. The height of the stand will be around 4 feet. The controlling of machine has to be done

            from this stand only. So ensure that you have quite a good range, so that you can control your car

            from one end (where you would be standing) to other.<br>

            3) The changes in obstacles, if any, will be duly addressed to you through mail. <br>

            4) Despite organizer’s efforts to keep the track’s quality intact, the track is subjected to undergo wear

            and tear as machines run over it. The machine is expected to be able to perform on such a weakened

            track as well. <br>

            5) Multiple machines will race on a single lane track at a time.<br>

            6) Information related to obstacles will be updated soon.<br><br/>

            <h5>Machine Specification:</h5>

            1. Machine should fit in a box of dimensions 400 x 230 x 120mm at any moment of time during the race.

            The external device which is used to control the machine is not included in the size constraint.<br>

            2. The machine should be controlled by a wireless remote control mechanism throughout the race. <br>

            3. The machine must not be made from Lego parts, or any ready-made assembly kits. Readily available

            chassis layouts are not allowed. Any machine found having a readymade chassis will be disqualified.<br>

            4. The machine parts may be roughly classified into structural and functional parts: Functional parts -

            Gears, differential gear, engine, springs, shock absorbers, servo motors, batteries, wheels and wheel hub

            can be directly used as available in the market. Structural parts - Chassis, steering mechanism, shock

            towers and suspension (excluding upper suspension arm, suspension spring and shock absorbers) have

            to be built by the participants themselves. <br>

            5. Judging for the same will be strict and the participant will be immediately disqualified if any of the

            above structural components are found to be ready-made. <br>

            6. The tires must have a preferable diameter of 3 inch. You are advised to use tires of good width for

            better performance on dirt tracks (especially for IC cars).<br>

            7. It is advised to have reverse mechanism, proper suspensions and steering, and apt ground

            clearance, so that the car can move smoothly over dirt track and ramps.<br></br>

            <h5>Propulsion & Steering</h5>

            1) Participants are advised to use a proper cooling mechanism to prevent overheating of the

            engine.<br>

            2) Participants are advised to use sway bars for better control and stability. <br>

            3) The participants are advised to use proper air filters as dirt might cause serious problems to the

            engine. <br>

            4) Readymade wheels are allowed.<br>

            5) It is advised to use slightly slower motors for off road racing, since the extra amount of effort to

            move along on rough ground or grass is going to generate more heat and put more strain on the

            motor. The motor / ESC will end up overheating and cutting out. Hence choose the appropriate

            motor for racing car.<br>

            6)<b> For IC Car Race:</b> The machine must use only mechanical power generated by an internal

            combustion (IC) engine for propulsion. However DC motors and servos can be used for steering

            mechanisms or any other control mechanisms apart from propulsion. Only one IC engine should

            be used in the machine. Use of any other sources such as chemicals, compressed gas, rockets

            etc. is not allowed. The maximum allowed capacity of IC engine to be used is 5 cc.	<br>
